Multi-Aster Swarming Simulations Using Cytosim

Neha Khetan, Athale Lab, IISER Pune 2017 
The files in the /cytosim/ folder contain all the source code in /src, /lib and /build folders that are needed to compile the code on a Linux or Mac system. The input file data.in contains paramters representative of the work that will generate collective multi-aster rotation. This work is described in detail in a preprint on ArXiv:

Aster Swarming by Collective Mechanics of Dyneins and Kinesins

The source code is based on an older version of Cytosim, a programme originally developed in the lab of Francois Nedelec at EMBL Heidelberg. Some of the motor models have been  modified by Chaitanya Athale and Neha Khetan and some updates are also seen in the publication 
Chaitanya A. Athale*, Dinarina A., Nedelec F. and Karsenti E. (2014) Collective behavior of minus-ended motors in mitotic microtubule asters gliding towards DNA. Phys. Biol. 11: 016008. https://doi.org/10.1088/1478-3975/11/1/016008
